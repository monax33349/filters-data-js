data.js has the input data for this assignment.

Write a method, that accepts 2 parameters: 
1. data array (from data.js)
2. object with filtering parameters.

After applying filtering, it displays matched results in console.

Example:

customFilter(dataArray, filteringObject){

    //your logic

    console.log(results);
}

Examples of filteringObject:
{category:'bal'} 
or
{category:'bal', region:'shoulders'}
or
{category:'bal', region:'shoulders', ID:'004'}


Requirements to logic:

- You do NOT know which keys will be in filteringObject
- You do NOT know if we are comparing strings, or match value inside of an array ( in data you can have "category": "bal" OR "category": ["bal", "air"] )
- Method needs to work with any param names, and any number of params
